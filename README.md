# tmux setup

```
THIS IS MY CONSOLE. THERE ARE MANY LIKE IT BUT THIS ONE'S MINE. MY CONSOLE IS MY
BEST FRIEND. IT IS MY LIFE. I MUST MASTER IT AS I MUST MASTER MY LIFE. WITHOUT
ME, MY CONSOLE IS USELESS. WITHOUT MY CONSOLE, I AM USELESS. I MUST CONFIGURE MY
CONSOLE TRUE. I MUST HACK BETTER THAN MY ENEMY WHO IS TRYING TO FLANK ME. I MUST
OBSOLETE HIM BEFORE HE OBSOLETES ME. I WILL! BEFORE RMS, I SWEAR THIS CREED. MY
CONSOLE AND MYSELF ARE DEFENDERS OF OUR FREEDOM. WE ARE THE MASTERS OF OUR ENEMY.
WE ARE THE SURVIVORS OF WINDOWS. SO BE IT, UNTIL THERE IS NO ENEMY, BUT PEACE.
AMEN!
